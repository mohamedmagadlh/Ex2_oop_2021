# Overview
This project represents the structure of a directed weighted graph.
---
## About the graph:
- This graph contains nodes and edges.
-  Each node has a one key no more.
-  Each edge has value presents weight, connect between src node and dest.
-  User can edit the graph by adding and removing nodes and edges.

### Algorithms
- Those algorithms was used to help to implement our methods.
- [Dijkstra's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
